      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a Master&amp;rsquo;s student in Computer Science at ETH Zürich and I am interested in exploring research areas at the intersection of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Specifically, I am interested in research problems that focus on perception, planning, and prediction for autonomous mobile robots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently working as a research intern at nuTonomy/Aptiv, Singapore wherein I am focusing on improving the performance of detection and tracking of objects in real-time both by using radar only, and by fusing multiple sensor modalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also part of the Akademischer Motorsportverein Zürich (AMZ) Driverless team for two seasons, wherein I worked on the LiDAR module of the car in the first season before leading the Perception and Software Architecture teams in the second season. &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/HegmIXASKow?t=11691&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a video showing our car «gotthard driverless» zooming around autonomously at the competition in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

My hobbies include playing sports, especially tennis, travelling, and photography. Some of my best photos can be found [here](http://500px.com/nikhilnb) and my travel journal can be found [here]()!
