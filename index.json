To limit the impact of such failures, this paper presents the redundant perception and state estimation approaches developed for an autonomous race car. Redundancy in perception is achieved by estimating the color and position of the track delimiting objects using two sensor modalities independently. Specifically, learning-based approaches are used to generate color and pose estimates, from LiDAR and camera data respectively. The redundant perception inputs are fused by a particle filter based SLAM algorithm that operates in real-time. Velocity is estimated using slip dynamics, with reliability being ensured through a probabilistic failure detection algorithm. The sub-modules are extensively evaluated in real-world racing conditions using the autonomous race car \u0026quot;gotthard driverless\u0026quot;, achieving lateral accelerations up to 1.7G and a top speed of 90km/h.","tags":null,"title":"Redundant Perception and State Estimation for Reliable Autonomous Racing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["BKSP Kumar Raju","**Nikhil Gosala**","G Geethakumari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483574400,"objectID":"a9ea04459ac2361049e1ca3b23c2996a","permalink":"http://nikhilgosala.github.io/publication/closer/","publishdate":"2017-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/closer/","section":"publication","summary":"The amalgamation of cloud computing and digital forensics created a new technological domain called cloud forensics. One of the technical challenges associated with cloud forensics is Event Reconstruction. Event reconstruction in cloud significantly differs from the traditional digital environment due to its multi-tenancy and large scale of events generated per unit time. In this paper, we suggest that effective event reconstruction is possible when the number of events in the target cloud evidence is reduced and we achieve the same by applying aggregation algorithms on cloud service logs. One of the popular log aggregation algorithms is the Leader-Follower (LF) algorithm. We observed that the LF algorithm, in its original form cannot be applied to cloud service logs. So, we propose two variants of it namely LFV1 and LFV2 to suit the aggregation requirements of cloud service logs.","tags":null,"title":"CLOSER: Applying aggregation for effective event reconstruction of cloud service logs","type":"publication"}]
